// This program reads measurements from a .dat file and writes the read
// temperature and time to a .txt-file.

//
// I'm not sure if you'll be having the same problem as me when writing to
// A.txt since we might use different compilers, but my compiler insists of
// writing the date as "  6" instead of " 06". While looking for a solution
// on stackoverflow, I saw that the implementation of asctime differs a bit
// between compilers when it comes to using zero-padding or space-padding
// on the date.
//
// I couldn't figure out if this was a problem you wanted me to solve or if
// it is something that I could ignore. I went with ignoring the problem,
// since the solution I would've implemented would be pretty simple but ugly,
// just checking if the date is one or two digits long and pad with zero if
// digits=2, so I didn't feel like it was necessary.
//
// Hopefully I didn't miss a part of the task for ignoring this. If so, sorry!
